# TypeScript Error Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing @angular/router Dependency
**Error**: `Cannot find module '@angular/router' or its corresponding type declarations`

**Fix**: Added `@angular/router` to package.json dependencies
```json
"@angular/router": "^20.3.0"
```

### 2. Signal Subscription Error
**Error**: `Property 'subscribe' does not exist on type 'WritableSignal<boolean>'`

**Fix**: Removed incorrect signal subscription in login component constructor. Signals don't have a `subscribe` method - they use `effect()` for side effects.

### 3. Type Mismatches Between UserDTO and Employee
**Error**: `Type 'UserDTO' is missing the following properties from type 'Employee': kudosSent, projectAssignments`

**Fixes Applied**:

#### a. Updated Models
- Added `UserDTO` interface to models.ts to match backend API response
- Kept existing `Employee` interface for frontend compatibility

#### b. Component Updates
- **Dashboard Component**: Updated `getProjectManager()` return type to `UserDTO`
- **Employees Component**: 
  - Added type conversion functions for `getEmployeeBadges()`
  - Updated `onSendKudos()` and `openAssignmentModal()` to handle UserDTO â†’ Employee conversion
- **Projects Component**: 
  - Updated all employee-related methods to work with `UserDTO`
  - Simplified project assignment logic (since backend doesn't have project assignments yet)

#### c. API Service
- Removed duplicate `UserDTO` interface (now imported from models.ts)
- Updated imports to include `UserDTO` from models

## Type Conversion Strategy

Since the backend `UserDTO` doesn't include all fields from the frontend `Employee` interface, we implemented conversion functions:

```typescript
// Convert UserDTO to Employee for frontend compatibility
const employeeForKudos: Employee = {
  id: employee.id,
  name: employee.name,
  role: employee.role as EmployeeRole,
  avatarUrl: employee.avatarUrl,
  kudosReceived: employee.kudosReceived,
  kudosBalance: employee.kudosBalance,
  kudosSent: 0, // Default value since UserDTO doesn't have this
  projectAssignments: [] // Default empty array since UserDTO doesn't have this
};
```

## Backend Compatibility Notes

The current backend API doesn't include:
- `kudosSent` field in user responses
- `projectAssignments` relationship

These are handled with default values in the frontend until the backend is extended to include these features.

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/package.json` - Added @angular/router dependency
2. `frontend/src/models.ts` - Added UserDTO interface
3. `frontend/src/services/api.service.ts` - Updated imports, removed duplicate interface
4. `frontend/src/components/auth/login.component.ts` - Fixed signal subscription
5. `frontend/src/components/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts` - Updated types
6. `frontend/src/components/employees/employees.component.ts` - Added type conversions
7. `frontend/src/components/projects/projects.component.ts` - Updated for UserDTO compatibility

## Result

All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved. The application now properly integrates the Angular frontend with the Spring Boot backend while maintaining type safety and compatibility.
